\# Learning Algorithms and Data Structures



This repository contains my personal implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structure concepts, created as part of my study and practice in computer science.



The main goal of this repository is learning: understanding how algorithms work internally, analyzing their complexity, and implementing them from scratch.



\## Contents



\- Algorithm implementations (e.g. binary search)

\- Simple exercises focused on logic and problem-solving

\- Code written primarily in Java



Each implementation prioritizes clarity and correctness over micro-optimizations.



\## Purpose



This repository is intended to:

\- Reinforce theoretical concepts through practice

\- Serve as a reference for future review

\- Track my progress while studying algorithms and data structures



It is not meant to be a production-ready library.



\## References



Some exercises and ideas are based on concepts studied from books and learning resources, such as:



\- \*Grokking Algorithms\* — Aditya Bhargava



All code is written independently as part of the learning process.



\## Notes



The repository may grow over time as new algorithms and exercises are added.
