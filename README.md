# Learning Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my personal implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structure concepts, developed as part of my study and practice.

The goal is to better understand how algorithms work internally, analyze their complexity, and implement them from scratch.

## Contents

- Algorithm implementations (e.g. binary search)
- Logic and problem-solving exercises

## Notes

This is a learning-focused repository, not a production-ready library.  
Some exercises are inspired by study materials such as *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Bhargava.
